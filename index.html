          Hello! My name is Harry Furusho and welcome to my portfolio site. Here
          you will find a page of projects that I've worked on, as well as how
          to contact me.
        </p>
        <p>
          A bit about myself: I graduated from the University of Washington with
          a Bachelor's of Science in applied physics. When I graduated, I was
          unsure if I wanted to have a career in physics and so I quickly got a
          job as a legal assistant through a roommate who had majored in
          political science. This was my first job and was a huge lesson in what
          kind of career I wanted. While law is interesting, I figured it wasn't
          for me. I then thought back to some of my favorite classes back in my
          undergrad and remembered how challenging but fun my programming
          classes were. So that brings things to now, where I am trying to
          further my knowledge of web development and make a career of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my spare time, I enjoy going for runs, longboarding, exploring the
          Pacific Northwest, or just hanging out with my friends and family.
