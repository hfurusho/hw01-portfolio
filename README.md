# hw01-portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This is where you'll find out a bit about myself and the projects I've worked on. You'll also find a form to contact me.

I created this portfolio using basic html and css. Some of the concepts that we're reinforced during the creation include floats, positioning, using psuedo selectors, and how to structure my html.
